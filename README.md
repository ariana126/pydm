## 🚀 Quick Start

### An example in your project:
```python
from pydm import ServiceContainer, EnvParametersBag
from dotenv import load_dotenv

class DatabaseConnectionInterface:
    pass
class MySQLConnection:
    def __init__(self, base_url: str):
        self.__base_url = base_url
class Repository:
    def __init__(self, conn: DatabaseConnectionInterface):
        self.__conn = conn

def boot() -> None:
    service_container: ServiceContainer = ServiceContainer.get_instance()

    load_dotenv()
    service_container.set_parameters(EnvParametersBag())

    service_container.bind_parameters(MySQLConnection, {'base_url': 'MYSQL_URL'})
    service_container.bind(DatabaseConnectionInterface, MySQLConnection)

boot()
repository = ServiceContainer.get_instance().get_service(Repository) # Repositoy instance
```

## 🧪 Running Tests
